<h2>CMSiMDE 程式架構</h2>
<p>動態網頁的主要檔案為 config/content.htm</p>
<p>當使用者在命令列中將目錄更換到 cmsimde, 然後以 python wsgi.py 執行 wsgi.py 程式時, 其實 Python 程式是仰賴 Flask 網際框架結構來進行資料伺服.</p>
<p>CMSiMDE 的作動需要 Flask 網際框架, 需要 bs4 與 lxml 進行 content.htm 的頁面解讀, 透過超文件檔案中的 h1, h2 與 h3 由上到下執行循序式分頁, 之後再透過 Javascript 與 css 將 h1, h2, h3 依照樹狀結構, h1 標題為第一階, h2 為第二階, h3 為第三階.</p>
<h3>為何需要網際內容管理</h3>
<p>全球資訊網無遠弗屆, 而且 WWW 的伺服架構相對於手機 APP 對於使用者而言更加友善, 除了允許多重身分無需實名綁定之外, 可以讓工程師進行各種協同設計, 因此若能廣泛利用網際環境建立各種應用程式環境, 將有助提升設計效益.</p>
<h3>如何建立 CMSiMDE 子模組</h3>
<p>git submodule add <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde.git">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde.git</a> cmsimde</p>
<p>表示要透過 git submodule add 將 <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde.git">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde.git</a> 遠端倉儲當作子模組, 而且將資料存入子目錄 cmsimde 中.</p>
<h3>為何需要以子模組的設計</h3>
<p>在一個倉儲中帶有子模組的用意是善用分散式設計的做法, 子模組代表一個非由倉儲管理者維護權限所及的單位模組. 意即, 倉儲中程式的執行需要子模組中的資料, 但是倉儲擁有者將子模組視為獨立元件, 並不需要對子模組的內容進行改版. 一旦子模組原始倉儲資料更新, 採用子模組的各倉儲所有者可以決定是否配合跟進, 若不跟進仍有使用既有版本的子模組繼續運作, 原始子模組與採用不同版本子模組的倉儲都不會彼此受到影響.</p>
<h3>兩種不同的 git clone</h3>
<p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde.git">https://github.com/mdecourse/cmsimde.git</a></p>
<p>表示要將 cmsimde 倉儲的資料 clone 到近端, 針對沒有子模組設置的倉儲可以直接以 git clone 取下倉儲資料</p>
<p>git clone --recurse-submodules <a href="https://github.com/mdecourse/cp2020.git">https://github.com/mdecourse/cp2020.git</a></p>
<p>表示要將 cp2020 倉儲中包含個子模組與可能子模組中的子模組等資料, 全部 clone 到近端.</p>
<h3>假如 CMSiMDE 不設為子模組</h3>
<p>其實各用戶若希望自行維護 CMSiMDE 網際內容管理系統, 可以直接取下 CMSiMDE 程式資料, 然後將倉儲資料放在 cmsimde 子目錄中, 並將 up_dir 中的資料複製一份到倉儲根目錄, 如此就可以依 CMSiMDE 的用法使用動態與靜態網頁.</p>
<h3>為何需要有動態網頁與靜態網頁</h3>
<p>所謂的動態網頁指的是有登入系統配置的網際內容管理系統, 當使用者登入後進行內容管理, 網站會馬上呈現新版本內容, 通常無需進行網頁轉換.</p>
<p>所謂的靜態網頁則指網站通常沒有登入系統的配置, 而且通常只包含 html 與 Javascript 資料, 由於沒有登入系統, 因此沒有內容被駭的問題, 除非負責伺服超文件網頁的系統遭駭.</p>
<p>而 CMSiMDE 的動態網頁用於編輯網站內容, 而靜態網頁則可以利用 Github Pages, Gitlab Pages 與 Heroku 進行伺服.</p>
<h3>CMSiMDE 有甚麼使用上的限制嗎比方說能夠使用那些特殊符號, 為什麼不能使用分號, 以及所謂的標題有沒有最多幾個字元的限制, 另外就是假如標題過長, 會發生甚麼狀況與後果</h3>
<p>假如在上列頁面標題中加上兩個 "?", 上面這個標題就無法順利分頁, 但是利用 SciTE 編輯 config/content.htm 之後將兩個 "?" 刪除後則可以正確完成分頁.</p>
<p>上面的標題字元數超過 80 個, 雖可正常分頁但是在資料展示上就顯得不很方便.</p>
<p>CMSiMDE 標題不能使用 ":" 的原因在於 Windows 操作系統不允許檔案名稱中有 ":", 因此當 CMSiMDE 動態轉靜態時必須以頁面標題作為該頁的檔案名稱, 而無法完成靜態頁面存檔的問題會讓 CMSiMDE 無法順利將動態資料轉為靜態資料.</p>

<p>overview</p>
<div class="section" id="N1059B">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105A2" lang="">In this module, we will discuss security, including common physical and digital prevention methods. When exploring digital security, we will take a deeper dive into user authentication, such as passwords. We will also discuss securing wireless and wired networks.</p>
<p lang="">Physical Security</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="physical_security">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105AF" lang="">While most people think of passwords, encryption, and firewalls as the best methods to protect a computer, they often forget that computer security begins with physical security. While this may sound quaint or silly, it is often the easiest method for an attacker to gain access to a system. After all, what good does a firewall do in protecting your computer from outside attack when the attacker is physically at the computer?</p>
<p id="N105B2" lang="">It is important to ensure that doors are locked so as to ensure the attackers are kept out of the building. Server rooms and communication closets must be kept under lock and key, as these are target-rich environments for attackers. Door locks come in a variety of styles, including the traditional key lock, while some organizations prefer more high-tech physical security devices such as digital numeric keypad locks, radio frequency identification (RFID) card systems, or even biometrics for entry, such as fingerprint readers or retina scanners.</p>
<p id="N105B5" lang="">Not only should the server rooms and communication closets be kept locked, but the main entrance to the facility should be secured, as well. If your organization restricts access to entry points, it is important that you be mindful of tailgating. Tailgating is the practice that occurs when another person tries to enter the facility immediately behind you, effectively using your card swipe or authentication to enter the facility. Many secure facilities use turnstile systems or<span> </span><a aria-describedby="N105B8" class="extra" id=""></a>mantraps<span> </span>to allow a single employee to enter upon swiping a card key or access badge, or entering a personal identification number. A mantrap is designed to prevent tailgating.</p>
<p id="N105BE" lang="">While physical access can be thwarted by locking doors and preventing tailgating, employees should also be mindful of protecting the physical data that exists in their workplace environment. To prevent work-desk disclosures, you should secure documents in locked file cabinets at the end of the day, shred any sensitive documents at the end of your shift, and refrain from writing down passwords on physical pieces of paper. Another good method to prevent prying eyes from seeing the documents with which you are working on the computer is to utilize a privacy filter over your monitor.</p>
<p id="N105C1" lang="">There are many methods of providing authentication to enter a facility, such as biometrics, key fobs, RFID, and smart cards. Biometric security systems utilize a reader or scanner to analyze the employee’s physical characteristics. For example, if a fingerprint reader is utilized, the reader can find a series of match points from the employee’s fingerprint, then compare them to a database of approved users. For retinal scans, the scanner reads match points in an employee’s retina. Some laptops and mobile devices now incorporate biometric data such as fingerprint readers in place of a username and password. Biometrics are more secure than a traditional username and password, but they are also more intrusive to the employee. Biometrics can also be used to authenticate you by certain unique traits or patterns you have such as comparing baseline models of your signature, voiceprint, heartbeat rhythm, and even keystroke measurements.</p>
<p id="N105C4" lang="">Other security identification methods are key fobs and RFID tags. Key fobs utilize a timing algorithm that is in sync with the global positioning system (GPS) satellites as a time source. The key fob then provides the user with a six-digit code that changes every 15–30 seconds. If the code is not entered within this time period, it becomes invalid and a new code is provided. This code is unique to the user and provides a unique method of authentication. RFID tags can be located in a key fob, access badge, or other device. These devices contain information about the identity of the user, which is passed to a reader using radio frequencies. These RFID tags are often combined with a security badge and a personal identification number (PIN), providing secure, two-factor authentication for the employee at physical access points, such as turnstiles and mantraps.</p>

</div>
<p id="N105D6" lang="">Another method of physical identification is the smart card. Smart cards are used by Department of Defense personnel. The cards act both as identification cards, much like driver’s licenses, and as login credentials for the users’ computers. A smart card contains a small nanoprocessor embedded in the card that contains digital certificates for email signing and encrypting functions. The card is placed into a reader connected to the computer via USB and is unlocked by providing the user’s personal identification number. Use of the smart card provides secure, two-factor authentication by using both the card and the PIN to unlock it.</p>

<p lang="">Password Security</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N105EA">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105F1" lang="">Security is increasingly a concern in our world, and requires controlling both physical and virtual access. Computer and data protection are vital to businesses large and small, and on a personal level as well. The industry model of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) has evolved from two-factor authentication to multi-factor authentication. When a user provides simply a username and password, this is considered single-factor authentication. In modern systems, as the need for security increases, so does the need for multiple factors of authentication.</p>
<p id="N105F4" lang="">The authentication measures employers require of employees ensure protections are verified through personal identification. Think of authentication levels as:</p>
<ol lang="">
<li lang="">Something you know: a username, password, pin, or another type of passcode or phrase.</li>
<li lang="">Something you have: a Smart Card, RFID tag, or some other token provided by the employer.</li>
<li lang="">Something you are: Biometric access through voice, fingerprint, or retinal identification.</li>
<li lang="">Something you do: another form of Biometrics using signature pattern analysis or voiceprint analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p id="N10605" lang="">“Something the user knows” is the easiest authentication for an attacker to overcome, because the attacker simply needs to guess or collect the user’s knowledge to gain access. “Something the user has” may be more difficult for an attacker to acquire, but not impossible. “Something the user is" should be the most difficult authentication measure to forge, but again, it is not impossible to do so. While movies contain many graphic representations on how to achieve this, there are real technological hacks available that do not require a body part. Biometric sensors can be fooled. “Something the user does” brings biometrics to a new level and is not very common except in the most secure environments. In addition to what somebody is, this authentication creates a baseline for comparative analysis of the person’s known patterns. Signature and voiceprint analysis, keyboards that identify the user by keystroke pressure and typing rate, and even physical measurements of heart rate, body heat, and blood pressure are now being used to complete this fourth type of authentication.</p>
<p id="N10608" lang="">To ensure a high level of security, many workstations and websites now require a minimum of two-factor authentication. As we previously mentioned, users accessing the Department of Defense computer systems are required to insert their Common Access Card (CAC), which is a Smart Card, and then enter a personal identification number to gain access to the system. This two-factor authentication provides both something the user has (the smart card) and something the user knows (the PIN) to authenticate the user and log the user onto the workstation.</p>

<p id="N1059C" lang="">In addition to the physical security, the computer must also be protected through digital security, as well. This takes many forms, including using antivirus/antispyware/antimalware software, firewalls, proper user authentication, securing the wireless network, and securing the rest of the network.</p>
<p lang="">Antivirus, Antispyware, and Antimalware Software</p>
<div class="section" id="N1059F">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105A6" lang="">Whether you are in a business or home computer environment, every device (tablet, cell phone, or workstation) should have antivirus, antispyware, and antimalware software installed. Most antivirus software now includes scanners for all three. This is specialized software that starts at boot-up and runs in the background of the machine protecting the device in real time from infections. By default, antivirus software will scan the machine when it boots to ensure there are no boot viruses or rootkits that will affect the startup process. In addition, the software should be scheduled to automatically run a full scan at periodic intervals for known and suspected threats.</p>
<p id="N105A9" lang="">The software must be kept up to date, as new viruses and malware are created all the time. In addition to keeping the program updated, the "signature" file, which tracks the latest threats, should check for updates daily. Most antivirus programs operate on a subscription basis, where the end user must pay an annual fee to keep the software up to date. However, there are excellent freeware programs available from third-party vendors. Additionally, this software provides access to the virus/malware threat encyclopedia, where the user can become more educated about a particular threat that exists.</p>
<p id="N105AC" lang="">Running antivirus/antimalware software protects the system against software threats that can affect not only that device, but the entire network. Often, antivirus software is offered as part of a suite of products including a firewall, browser protection, password management, and family controls that allow permissions-based access to the Internet. Good antivirus software will also integrate into the user’s locally installed email program, ensuring scanning of all downloaded files and sent/received emails.</p>
<p id="N105AF" lang="">Since Windows Vista, Microsoft has included Windows Defender as an installed product that can run concurrently with third-party vendors. From Windows 8 on, it is an either/or proposition, where Defender will be disabled once you install another antivirus product.</p>
<p lang="">Firewalls</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="firewalls">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105BC" lang="">Firewalls are either hardware devices or software programs that are designed to examine data packets that traverse the network connection. This includes IP header information, such as the destination or source IP addresses, the application ports and data being utilized, or the protocols being used. Based on this information, the firewall makes the determination to either allow or block the particular network traffic. In Windows Vista (by configuration) and from Windows 7 on (by default), there is a two-way firewall solution. In addition to running locally on each machine, the Windows software-based firewall can be managed by a Windows server.</p>
<p id="N105BF" lang="">Hardware firewalls are dedicated network appliances with specially designed operating systems that are more efficient at protecting multiple devices in the network. Often, networks utilize a hardware firewall at the network boundary to protect the entire network from a broad range of attacks, while software firewalls are configured to protect specific workstations from specifically targeted attacks. A technician should never install more than one software firewall on a workstation, as two firewalls can conflict and block valid network traffic from flowing properly. Also, note that Windows comes with its own software firewalls integrated into the operating system, but they can be turned off if a third-party, more in-depth solution is desired.</p>
<p id="N105C2" lang="">Firewalls can block legitimate network traffic if they are misconfigured. It is important that the technician check the firewall settings if a program appears to not be working properly to ensure the correct TCP or UDP ports are opened in the firewall. For example, if a user complains that their email program is unable to send emails, it may be that the firewall is configured to block traffic over port 25 (the SMTP — simple mail transfer protocol — server).</p>
<p lang="">Least Privilege</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="least_privilege">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105CF" lang="">A common security best practice is that of “least privilege.” This principle dictates that a user should only be given access to the minimum permissions and groups that they need to perform their job functions. For example, if the user is a data entry clerk, he may need to be able to update spreadsheet files and browse the Internet, therefore he should be given standard user access, not administrator access. This may seem like common sense, but it can become difficult to manage permissions once you begin working on a large-scale network. It is imperative that the administrator who is creating the user accounts and placing them into the groups take extreme care to place the users in the proper groups.</p>
<p id="N105D2" lang="">As an administrator, be aware that when you install a program under Windows Vista or Windows 7, the program often will ask which user groups should have access to the program, with the default option often being “all users.” This may not be the correct option, especially if the software is something you only wish for the administrators to access. Remember, organizations use groups for classifying users into need-to-know or need-to-access groups. So giving users additional, unnecessary groups can allow the users to access information that management does not wish certain people to access.</p>

<p id="N105A4" lang="">User authentication typically relies on the user providing a username and password, but in modern networks the need for security is changing this requirement. When a user provides simply a username and password, this is considered single-factor authentication. In modern systems, as the need for security increases, so does the need for multiple factors of authentication, such as two-factor authentication (at a minimum) or multi-factor authentication.</p>
<p id="N105A7" lang="">There are four common categories of authentication:</p>
<ol lang="">
<li lang="">Something the user knows.</li>
<li lang="">Something the user has.</li>
<li lang="">Something the user is.</li>
<li lang="">Something the user does.</li>
</ol>
<p id="N105B9" lang="">Something the user knows is typically used by most systems, such as the user providing a username, password, or personal identification number (PIN). This is also the easiest authentication for an attacker to overcome, since they simply need to guess or collect the user’s knowledge to gain access. The second category is something the user has, which is usually fulfilled by the user presenting a smart card, security token, or RFID chip. The third category is something the user is, which usually refers to some biometric data about the user. This could be the user’s fingerprint, retina scan, or even voice authentication. The fourth and final category is something the user does, such as how the user’s signature looks. This is a very uncommon authentication method for workstation or website access, but is used heavily in payment systems, such as credit card terminals.</p>
<p id="N105BC" lang="">To ensure a high level of security, many workstations and websites now require two-factor authentication. As mentioned earlier in this module, in the Department of Defense computer systems, the user is required to insert their CAC (common access card), which is a smart card, and also enter a personal identification number to gain access to the system. This two-factor authentication provides both something the user has (the smart card) and something the user knows (the PIN) to authenticate the user and log the user on to a Windows workstation.</p>
<p lang="">Passwords</p>
<div class="section" id="N105BF">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105C6" lang="">Because usernames and passwords are the most common method of authentication, we will dig a little deeper into the best practices for a password system. Passwords can be verified by the local system, such as by using a username/password with a local PC or an access code number for a digital door lock. Passwords can also be verified by using a remote server, such as when a domain user logs in to a workstation connected to a domain controller. The local system does not verify the password; the domain controller does.</p>
<p id="N105C9" lang="">The threat of security breaches has changed the whole concept of passwords from the days when they were simply used to keep another user from accessing your profile. Data has become an important form of currency throughout the world, so the need for password complexity has evolved. The first rule of data security, which most users will admit to breaking sometimes, is to never write down a password on paper and leave it in the desk or on a sticky note on the desk or monitor. Passwords need to be memorized or stored in a password manager utility where access is controlled by a single password. The second rule, which is also often broken, is to never use the same password for multiple different things. Some of the most recents hacks have involved two or more databases from online vendors, and the attackers were able to merge the information to develop usernames and passwords. Those using the same password for multiple accounts were most vulnerable.</p>
<p id="N105CC" lang="">Passwords can be verified by the local system, such as by using a username/password on a local PC or an access code number for a digital door lock. Passwords can also be verified by using a remote server, such as when a domain user logs in to a workstation connected to a domain controller. The local system does not verify the password; the domain controller does.</p>
<p id="N105CF" lang="">Passwords must be complex, containing a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, passwords should be long: they should be at least 6–8 characters in length, but more characters provide a more secure password. It is imperative to avoid dictionary words, as these are easier to guess, and consider using a passphrase if possible. One technique to create a strong password is to pick a song or poem and use the first letter from each word as the password, as well as incorporating some numbers and symbols. This makes a strong, hard-to-guess password.</p>
<p id="N105D2" lang="">The system administrator has the ability to configure the password system in Windows to create rules that the passwords must follow. These settings should be in line with company policy and should follow the best practices mentioned above, as well as adding some new requirements. One practice is requiring passwords to be renewed every 60 days. Setting a maximum password age eliminates threats from old access lists or former employees. The system can be set up to prompt users to change their passwords approximately 14 days prior to expiration. Also, the system administrator can set the system to require a minimum password length, such as six characters or 14 characters. There is an option to require complex passwords — passwords that require uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and symbolic characters. Another option is to prevent old passwords from being reused, with a setting that can dictate how many old passwords are remembered by the system. This is called password history. The system administrator can set the limit on password history up to 25 previous passwords in memory. Finally, if an attacker is trying to guess a user’s password, there is a setting that will prevent this by locking the user’s account if a certain number of unsuccessful logins occur within a certain period of time. For example, if four failed logins occur within 15 minutes, the system might require a 60-minute wait before letting the user log in (even if the user tries the correct password) or might require the system administrator to reset the password.</p>
