<p>PCS 16 /Data Destruction and Disposal</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<div class="section" id="N1059B">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105A2" lang="">In this module, we will review different methods for destroying data and hard drives. We will also discuss methods to overwrite a hard drive correctly.</p>
<p lang="">Low-Level Format vs. Standard Format</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="N105A7">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105AE" lang="">Most of us are familiar with formatting disk drives. A common myth is that formatting disk drives destroys data. The primary purpose of formatting a disk is to prepare it for a new operating system installation, and in order for that to be effective, any data currently on the disk needs to be erased or set off by internal pointers that allow the data occupying those sectors to be saved and rewritten after the reformat.</p>
<p id="N105B1" lang="">The standard format process, or high-level format, can be done two ways — the quick format and the full format. The quick format prepares a disk to receive a file structure, such as FAT32 or NTFS, while the full format also checks the drive for bad sectors and marks them. In all versions of Windows since Windows Vista, the full format also writes zeros and ones to the partitions.</p>
<p id="N105B4" lang="">A quick format doesn't really destroy data, it merely removes the index for the file structure, making it slightly harder to find a file. However, the data is not gone, and there are a number of software tools available that will recover files from a disk that has undergone a quick format. There are, however, tools available that will write random zeros and ones to the disk during the formatting process, which is an effective data destruction method.</p>
<p id="N105B7" lang="">Low-level formatting is different, and is an effective means of destroying data, but cannot be truly accomplished after a hard disk drive is manufactured. Due to the nature of modern ATA/IDE drives, where the disk geometry varies by manufacturer, true low-level formatting occurs only during the manufacturing process and cannot be redone after a disk has been placed into service by a user or technician. This is because the low-level format actually defines the position of tracks and sectors on the drive. However, the major HDD manufacturers do make utilities available that will reinitialize a disk, test it for bad sectors, write zeros and ones to the sectors, and repartition their own disks. This is the closest technicians can get to low-level formatting.</p>
<p id="N105BA" lang="">Standard formatting occurs from within the operating system. For example, a technician can connect a new external hard disk in Windows File Explorer and simply right-click the disk and then select Format, as shown in the image below. This will then perform a standard format of the new drive.</p>

</div>
<p id="N105CC" lang="">This process will then erase the file allocation table (FAT) if the drive is formatted with a FAT file system, or erase the file pointers if the file system is NTFS (New Technology File System). This does not erase the data on the drive, only the method to access the data through a normal operating system. It is still possible for a technician to recover the data using software tools built for that purpose.</p>

<li lang="">In an OS prior to Windows Vista, both the quick and full format methods only prepare a disk to receive a file structure. The full format also checks the drive for bad sectors and marks them.</li>

<li lang="">A standard format does not destroy the files, only the index for the file structure.</li>

Hard Drive Data Destruction Methods</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="destruction_methods">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N105F5" lang="">There are three accepted ways to perform HDD data destruction. They are:</p>
<ul lang="">
<li lang="">Clearing</li>
<li lang="">Sanitizing or purging</li>
<li lang="">Physical destruction</li>
</ul>
<p id="N10604" lang="">If the disk is to be repurposed in another workstation within the company, or the workstation is to be donated to another organization, it is important that the data be destroyed without destroying the hard disk. To accomplish this task, a technician can perform a low-level format using the HDD manufacturer’s software and ensure that it writes zeros and ones to the disk at least one time. This is known as<span> </span><a aria-describedby="N10607" class="extra" id=""></a>clearing<span> </span>.</p>
<p id="N1060D" lang="">There are many programs on the market that meet or exceed the Department of Defense 5220.22-M standard. This refers to the 1997 Department of Defense National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) guidelines requiring government contractors to follow exact procedures for dealing with classified data needing to be<span> </span><a aria-describedby="N10610" class="extra" id=""></a>sanitized<span> </span>. Seven passes of rewrites became the de facto standard adopted in the computer industry as an effective means to recycle HDDs and keep them in service.</p>
<p id="N10616" lang=""><a aria-describedby="N10618" class="extra" id=""></a>Peter Gutmann<span> </span>increased this standard to a 35-pass overwrite. During this process, each and every bit of the hard disk is overwritten with a zero or one or a random character. Once the end of the disk is reached, the program starts again at the beginning until the entire disk has been overwritten at least 35 times. For most uses, however, seven times is sufficient to prevent data recovery.</p>
<p id="N1061E" lang="">Programs that accomplish this are often referred to as disk wiping, disk scrubbing, or drive wiping programs. Note that these methods take a significant amount of time, especially if the hard disk is large in capacity, since every bit has to be overwritten numerous times.</p>
<p id="N10621" lang="">Due to the increased awareness of security and changing nature of HDD storage design, the industry is moving away from the DOD 5220.22-M standard, which is no longer in publication. According to an<span> </span><a href="http://www.infosecisland.com/blogview/16130-The-Urban-Legend-of-Multipass-Hard-Disk-Overwrite.html" id="_i_2" lang="" target="_blank">article by Brian Smithson on Infosec Island</a>, the current standard to follow is the National Institute of Standards and Technology “<a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-88r1.pdf" id="_i_3" lang="" target="_blank">NIST Special Publication 800-88</a>.” Current research is leading the industry to use the “secure erase” techniques identified in this standard, and finds that a “single-pass overwrite” is sufficient.</p>
<p id="N1062F" lang="">Another option to permanently purge the data on a disk is to use electromagnets to degauss (demagnetize) the hard disk. Systems that demagnetize disks are very expensive and are only in use in very high-security environments. Some companies offer disposal of hard disk drives through a pay-for-service model. Often, it is more economical for small businesses to pay for disposal service than to buy expensive equipment.</p>
<p id="N10632" lang="">When dealing with CDs, DVDs, or floppy disks, the best method of destruction is physical destruction, because these media are very inexpensive to replace. The easiest method to use to destroy these are shredders specifically built for this task, which usually cost around $50–$100.</p>
<p id="N10635" lang="">While a quick erase of the data can prevent access to it by a normal computer user, the residual data left after a removal process, known as data remanence, can still be retrieved by most technicians or hackers. Data recovery tools are becoming more readily available, better at recovering data, and easier to use, which makes recovery of deleted files well within the reach of many users. For this reason, the best method to make data inaccessible is to physically destroy the hard drive. This can be accomplished via a number of different methods, including destroying the platters using a hammer, drill, or other mechanical device, leaving the drive only usable for recycling as scrap metal. Destruction is the most secure method to permanently eliminate data.</p>
<p lang="">Choosing the Right Method for Secure Data Destruction</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="choosing_the_right_method">
<div class="sectionContain">
<p id="N10642" lang="">When time is more of a concern, and data security is less of a concern, a quick format can be appropriate. However, because a skilled technician or hacker can recover data after a quick format, it is best to do a full format when a computer will be repurposed within a company.</p>
<p id="N10645" lang="">If you or your company is throwing away a computer, there is a concern that sensitive or confidential information might be accessed by another person. Therefore, a quick format is not the best option, and, even though a full format might be sufficient, liability and responsibility for ensuring nobody can ever access any old data may demand physical destruction, such as drilling holes through the hard drive platters, smashing the drives with a hammer, or burning the drives. Physical destruction is the best permanent solution to prevent data recovery.</p>
<p id="N10648" lang="">If you or your company is selling or transferring the computer to another organization, physical destruction is not an option, and quick formatting is insufficient. In this instance, the disk should be wiped following the DOD 5220.22-M standard by overwriting the disk with zeros and ones in each bit seven to 35 times or using Secure Erase, as discussed in “NIST Special Publication 800-88.”</p>

<p id="N10682" lang="">Right-clicking the (E:) drive to bring up the Format option.</p>
</div>
<p id="N10686" lang="">Next, we will choose what type of file system we want on our drive. The file system is just the way that data is stored on and accessed from the volume. There are several different file systems. NTFS is the native file system used by all Microsoft operating systems since Windows NT 4.0, replacing the FAT32 file system used by Windows 95 and Windows 98. NTFS is required for any boot volume from Windows Vista and later. FAT32 is an older type of file system that is not compatible with and is less secure than NTFS, but can be read and written to by an NTFS operating system. Although Apple uses HFS and HFS+ file systems, an Apple computer can read and write to FAT32. However, FAT32 has size limitations. It cannot be used on disks larger than 32 GB and cannot store files larger than 4 GB. For this reason, it is typically used for USB drives or removable drives that might be used between different OS platforms, such as Apple or Linux machines.</p>
<p id="N10689" lang="">In our example, we’ll accept the default of NTFS. We can also choose here whether to perform a quick format (selected by default), or a full format (by unchecking the quick format option). We’ll do a quick format.</p>

<p id="N106BB" lang="">In this lab exercise, assume you have installed a second hard drive, called Disk 1, into this computer. You should format this new hard drive for use.</p>
<p id="N106BE" lang=""><iframe data-mce-fragment="1" frameborder="0" height="680" id="_i_12" src="https://oli.cmu.edu/repository/webcontent/d824e08a0a0001dc23651919041a0b35/webcontent/format_drive/index.html" width="810"></iframe></p>
<p id="N106C7" lang="">Note that the Windows tools work well in situations where you’re formatting a second drive on a computer, or where you’re formatting a drive that can be temporarily installed into another computer. Remember that in order to run the Windows tools, it’s necessary to have a drive running Windows, so that drive can’t be the one you’re formatting!</p>
<p id="N106CA" lang="">If you need to format a single drive in a computer, and it’s not possible to temporarily remove the drive and install it into another computer, then the best option is to use the Windows installer tools on your Windows installation DVD or from the Recovery partition. If you boot the computer from the Windows installation DVD, you will have an option to format the drive before reinstalling Windows.</p></div></div></div></div></div></li></ol></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><br />p70英 << <a href='p70英.html'>Previous</a> </div>
