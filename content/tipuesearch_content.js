When exploring digital security, we will take a deeper dive into user authentication, such as passwords. We will also discuss securing wireless and wired networks. \n Physical Security \n \n \n \n \n While most people think of passwords, encryption, and firewalls as the best methods to protect a computer, they often forget that computer security begins with physical security. While this may sound quaint or silly, it is often the easiest method for an attacker to gain access to a system. After all, what good does a firewall do in protecting your computer from outside attack when the attacker is physically at the computer? \n It is important to ensure that doors are locked so as to ensure the attackers are kept out of the building. Server rooms and communication closets must be kept under lock and key, as these are target-rich environments for attackers. Door locks come in a variety of styles, including the traditional key lock, while some organizations prefer more high-tech physical security devices such as digital numeric keypad locks, radio frequency identification (RFID) card systems, or even biometrics for entry, such as fingerprint readers or retina scanners. \n Not only should the server rooms and communication closets be kept locked, but the main entrance to the facility should be secured, as well. If your organization restricts access to entry points, it is important that you be mindful of tailgating. Tailgating is the practice that occurs when another person tries to enter the facility immediately behind you, effectively using your card swipe or authentication to enter the facility. Many secure facilities use turnstile systems or \xa0 mantraps \xa0 to allow a single employee to enter upon swiping a card key or access badge, or entering a personal identification number. A mantrap is designed to prevent tailgating. \n While physical access can be thwarted by locking doors and preventing tailgating, employees should also be mindful of protecting the physical data that exists in their workplace environment. To prevent work-desk disclosures, you should secure documents in locked file cabinets at the end of the day, shred any sensitive documents at the end of your shift, and refrain from writing down passwords on physical pieces of paper. Another good method to prevent prying eyes from seeing the documents with which you are working on the computer is to utilize a privacy filter over your monitor. \n There are many methods of providing authentication to enter a facility, such as biometrics, key fobs, RFID, and smart cards. Biometric security systems utilize a reader or scanner to analyze the employee’s physical characteristics. For example, if a fingerprint reader is utilized, the reader can find a series of match points from the employee’s fingerprint, then compare them to a database of approved users. For retinal scans, the scanner reads match points in an employee’s retina. Some laptops and mobile devices now incorporate biometric data such as fingerprint readers in place of a username and password. Biometrics are more secure than a traditional username and password, but they are also more intrusive to the employee. Biometrics can also be used to authenticate you by certain unique traits or patterns you have such as comparing baseline models of your signature, voiceprint, heartbeat rhythm, and even keystroke measurements. \n Other security identification methods are key fobs and RFID tags. Key fobs utilize a timing algorithm that is in sync with the global positioning system (GPS) satellites as a time source. The key fob then provides the user with a six-digit code that changes every 15–30 seconds. If the code is not entered within this time period, it becomes invalid and a new code is provided. This code is unique to the user and provides a unique method of authentication. RFID tags can be located in a key fob, access badge, or other device. These devices contain information about the identity of the user, which is passed to a reader using radio frequencies. These RFID tags are often combined with a security badge and a personal identification number (PIN), providing secure, two-factor authentication for the employee at physical access points, such as turnstiles and mantraps. \n \n RFID key fobs by RSA. Image used under CC-BY-SA license from \xa0 Wikipedia . \n \n Another method of physical identification is the smart card. Smart cards are used by Department of Defense personnel. The cards act both as identification cards, much like driver’s licenses, and as login credentials for the users’ computers. A smart card contains a small nanoprocessor embedded in the card that contains digital certificates for email signing and encrypting functions. The card is placed into a reader connected to the computer via USB and is unlocked by providing the user’s personal identification number. Use of the smart card provides secure, two-factor authentication by using both the card and the PIN to unlock it. \n \n Sample smart card. Image used under CC-BY-SA license from \xa0 Wikimedia . \n Password Security \n \n \n \n \n \n Security is increasingly a concern in our world, and requires controlling both physical and virtual access. Computer and data protection are vital to businesses large and small, and on a personal level as well. The industry model of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) has evolved from two-factor authentication to multi-factor authentication. When a user provides simply a username and password, this is considered single-factor authentication. In modern systems, as the need for security increases, so does the need for multiple factors of authentication. \n The authentication measures employers require of employees ensure protections are verified through personal identification. Think of authentication levels as: \n \n Something you know: a username, password, pin, or another type of passcode or phrase. \n Something you have: a Smart Card, RFID tag, or some other token provided by the employer. \n Something you are: Biometric access through voice, fingerprint, or retinal identification. \n Something you do: another form of Biometrics using signature pattern analysis or voiceprint analysis. \n \n “Something the user knows” is the easiest authentication for an attacker to overcome, because the attacker simply needs to guess or collect the user’s knowledge to gain access. “Something the user has” may be more difficult for an attacker to acquire, but not impossible. “Something the user is" should be the most difficult authentication measure to forge, but again, it is not impossible to do so. While movies contain many graphic representations on how to achieve this, there are real technological hacks available that do not require a body part. Biometric sensors can be fooled. “Something the user does” brings biometrics to a new level and is not very common except in the most secure environments. In addition to what somebody is, this authentication creates a baseline for comparative analysis of the person’s known patterns. Signature and voiceprint analysis, keyboards that identify the user by keystroke pressure and typing rate, and even physical measurements of heart rate, body heat, and blood pressure are now being used to complete this fourth type of authentication. \n To ensure a high level of security, many workstations and websites now require a minimum of two-factor authentication. As we previously mentioned, users accessing the Department of Defense computer systems are required to insert their Common Access Card (CAC), which is a Smart Card, and then enter a personal identification number to gain access to the system. This two-factor authentication provides both something the user has (the smart card) and something the user knows (the PIN) to authenticate the user and log the user onto the workstation. \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P62英.html'}, {'title': 'P63英', 'text': 'PCS 14 \xa0 / Digital Security \n In addition to the physical security, the computer must also be protected through digital security, as well. This takes many forms, including using antivirus/antispyware/antimalware software, firewalls, proper user authentication, securing the wireless network, and securing the rest of the network. \n Antivirus, Antispyware, and Antimalware Software \n \n \n Whether you are in a business or home computer environment, every device (tablet, cell phone, or workstation) should have antivirus, antispyware, and antimalware software installed. Most antivirus software now includes scanners for all three. This is specialized software that starts at boot-up and runs in the background of the machine protecting the device in real time from infections. By default, antivirus software will scan the machine when it boots to ensure there are no boot viruses or rootkits that will affect the startup process. In addition, the software should be scheduled to automatically run a full scan at periodic intervals for known and suspected threats. \n The software must be kept up to date, as new viruses and malware are created all the time. In addition to keeping the program updated, the "signature" file, which tracks the latest threats, should check for updates daily. Most antivirus programs operate on a subscription basis, where the end user must pay an annual fee to keep the software up to date. However, there are excellent freeware programs available from third-party vendors. Additionally, this software provides access to the virus/malware threat encyclopedia, where the user can become more educated about a particular threat that exists. \n Running antivirus/antimalware software protects the system against software threats that can affect not only that device, but the entire network. Often, antivirus software is offered as part of a suite of products including a firewall, browser protection, password management, and family controls that allow permissions-based access to the Internet. Good antivirus software will also integrate into the user’s locally installed email program, ensuring scanning of all downloaded files and sent/received emails. \n Since Windows Vista, Microsoft has included Windows Defender as an installed product that can run concurrently with third-party vendors. From Windows 8 on, it is an either/or proposition, where Defender will be disabled once you install another antivirus product. \n Firewalls \n \n \n \n \n Firewalls are either hardware devices or software programs that are designed to examine data packets that traverse the network connection. This includes IP header information, such as the destination or source IP addresses, the application ports and data being utilized, or the protocols being used. Based on this information, the firewall makes the determination to either allow or block the particular network traffic. In Windows Vista (by configuration) and from Windows 7 on (by default), there is a two-way firewall solution. In addition to running locally on each machine, the Windows software-based firewall can be managed by a Windows server. \n Hardware firewalls are dedicated network appliances with specially designed operating systems that are more efficient at protecting multiple devices in the network. Often, networks utilize a hardware firewall at the network boundary to protect the entire network from a broad range of attacks, while software firewalls are configured to protect specific workstations from specifically targeted attacks. A technician should never install more than one software firewall on a workstation, as two firewalls can conflict and block valid network traffic from flowing properly. Also, note that Windows comes with its own software firewalls integrated into the operating system, but they can be turned off if a third-party, more in-depth solution is desired. \n Firewalls can block legitimate network traffic if they are misconfigured. It is important that the technician check the firewall settings if a program appears to not be working properly to ensure the correct TCP or UDP ports are opened in the firewall. For example, if a user complains that their email program is unable to send emails, it may be that the firewall is configured to block traffic over port 25 (the SMTP — simple mail transfer protocol — server). \n Least Privilege \n \n \n \n \n A common security best practice is that of “least privilege.” This principle dictates that a user should only be given access to the minimum permissions and groups that they need to perform their job functions. For example, if the user is a data entry clerk, he may need to be able to update spreadsheet files and browse the Internet, therefore he should be given standard user access, not administrator access. This may seem like common sense, but it can become difficult to manage permissions once you begin working on a large-scale network. It is imperative that the administrator who is creating the user accounts and placing them into the groups take extreme care to place the users in the proper groups. \n As an administrator, be aware that when you install a program under Windows Vista or Windows 7, the program often will ask which user groups should have access to the program, with the default option often being “all users.” This may not be the correct option, especially if the software is something you only wish for the administrators to access. Remember, organizations use groups for classifying users into need-to-know or need-to-access groups. So giving users additional, unnecessary groups can allow the users to access information that management does not wish certain people to access. \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P63英.html'}, {'title': 'P64英', 'text': 'PCS 14 \xa0 / User Authentication \n User authentication typically relies on the user providing a username and password, but in modern networks the need for security is changing this requirement. When a user provides simply a username and password, this is considered single-factor authentication. In modern systems, as the need for security increases, so does the need for multiple factors of authentication, such as two-factor authentication (at a minimum) or multi-factor authentication. \n There are four common categories of authentication: \n \n Something the user knows. \n Something the user has. \n Something the user is. \n Something the user does. \n \n Something the user knows is typically used by most systems, such as the user providing a username, password, or personal identification number (PIN). This is also the easiest authentication for an attacker to overcome, since they simply need to guess or collect the user’s knowledge to gain access. The second category is something the user has, which is usually fulfilled by the user presenting a smart card, security token, or RFID chip. The third category is something the user is, which usually refers to some biometric data about the user. This could be the user’s fingerprint, retina scan, or even voice authentication. The fourth and final category is something the user does, such as how the user’s signature looks. This is a very uncommon authentication method for workstation or website access, but is used heavily in payment systems, such as credit card terminals. \n To ensure a high level of security, many workstations and websites now require two-factor authentication. As mentioned earlier in this module, in the Department of Defense computer systems, the user is required to insert their CAC (common access card), which is a smart card, and also enter a personal identification number to gain access to the system. This two-factor authentication provides both something the user has (the smart card) and something the user knows (the PIN) to authenticate the user and log the user on to a Windows workstation. \n Passwords \n \n \n Because usernames and passwords are the most common method of authentication, we will dig a little deeper into the best practices for a password system. Passwords can be verified by the local system, such as by using a username/password with a local PC or an access code number for a digital door lock. Passwords can also be verified by using a remote server, such as when a domain user logs in to a workstation connected to a domain controller. The local system does not verify the password; the domain controller does. \n The threat of security breaches has changed the whole concept of passwords from the days when they were simply used to keep another user from accessing your profile. Data has become an important form of currency throughout the world, so the need for password complexity has evolved. The first rule of data security, which most users will admit to breaking sometimes, is to never write down a password on paper and leave it in the desk or on a sticky note on the desk or monitor. Passwords need to be memorized or stored in a password manager utility where access is controlled by a single password. The second rule, which is also often broken, is to never use the same password for multiple different things. Some of the most recents hacks have involved two or more databases from online vendors, and the attackers were able to merge the information to develop usernames and passwords. Those using the same password for multiple accounts were most vulnerable. \n Passwords can be verified by the local system, such as by using a username/password on a local PC or an access code number for a digital door lock. Passwords can also be verified by using a remote server, such as when a domain user logs in to a workstation connected to a domain controller. The local system does not verify the password; the domain controller does. \n Passwords must be complex, containing a mixture of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, passwords should be long: they should be at least 6–8 characters in length, but more characters provide a more secure password. It is imperative to avoid dictionary words, as these are easier to guess, and consider using a passphrase if possible. One technique to create a strong password is to pick a song or poem and use the first letter from each word as the password, as well as incorporating some numbers and symbols. This makes a strong, hard-to-guess password. \n The system administrator has the ability to configure the password system in Windows to create rules that the passwords must follow. These settings should be in line with company policy and should follow the best practices mentioned above, as well as adding some new requirements. One practice is requiring passwords to be renewed every 60 days. Setting a maximum password age eliminates threats from old access lists or former employees. The system can be set up to prompt users to change their passwords approximately 14 days prior to expiration. Also, the system administrator can set the system to require a minimum password length, such as six characters or 14 characters. There is an option to require complex passwords — passwords that require uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and symbolic characters. Another option is to prevent old passwords from being reused, with a setting that can dictate how many old passwords are remembered by the system. This is called password history. The system administrator can set the limit on password history up to 25 previous passwords in memory. Finally, if an attacker is trying to guess a user’s password, there is a setting that will prevent this by locking the user’s account if a certain number of unsuccessful logins occur within a certain period of time. For example, if four failed logins occur within 15 minutes, the system might require a 60-minute wait before letting the user log in (even if the user tries the correct password) or might require the system administrator to reset the password. \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P64英.html'}, {'title': 'P65英', 'text': "PCS 14 \xa0 / Education \n In addition to securing a wireless network, it is also important to secure a wired network. Just like the wireless network, the wired switch can be configured to support MAC address filtering. Additionally, any unused network ports should be turned off, as this will prevent a local attacker from connecting to an available port to use in their attacks. Also, cover any unused network jacks. For example, you would not want an open and available network jack in the waiting area of your business to be used by a would-be attacker. Finally, consider if your network should use static or dynamic addressing. \n Static IP addresses are more secure, because they require an attacker to know the manual configuration for your network to gain access, but it is more time consuming for administrators, especially if your organization has a very large network. Static IPs should be used at a minimum for servers and devices that must be regularly contacted for their services, such as shared scanners and printers. If your organization uses dynamic addresses, it is a good practice to limit the scope of the DHCP server. This will allow clients to gain access to the network, but will minimize the number of overall IPs available. \n \n EXAMPLE \n \n \n \n If your company has 50 clients, then you should only allow 50 DHCP connections. If an attacker tries to connect to your network, she won’t be given an IP address because your 50 available connections are already used by the company’s 50 clients. \n User Education \n \n \n \n \n \n User education is the most important thing an organization can do to protect its network. If your users do not understand security threats, they will be unable to help your administrators fight the attackers. The employees must be made aware of any company policy for computer use, data protection, and allowed devices. Signing a form at the initial hire is not sufficient, and it is the IT administrator's duty to ensure that periodic training is completed. If it is company policy that users must keep their workstations up to date with the latest security patches, antivirus signatures, antimalware signatures, and antispyware signatures, then system administrators must assist with that process. Most IT departments handle patches and updates for their users, and the users are only responsible for antivirus scanning or ensuring that they don't tamper with the automated scanning schedule. \n Administrators can use group policy to audit users' activity on the network and can require remediation, counseling, or training if the company policy is violated. Administrative tools are available to suspend users' access in the event that they violate policy or put the network at risk. Administrators should disable auto run on users' machines and should ensure that users understand that they should not install unapproved programs or insert removable media into the workstation without prior antivirus scanning. Bring your own device (BYOD) policies need to be clear so that employees understand what is allowed and what is not. Celluar telephones may be allowed on the network, but a wireless access point should not. The weakest area in most organizations is email access. Training employees how to spot potential spam or malicious attachments is essential. \n The more you can educate users about risk and prevention, the more users will be prevented from falling for attackers’ tricks, such as \xa0 phishing \xa0 emails, and the more secure your network will be. All the firewalls and security software available will not do any good to protect your network if a user gives the attacker access and allows the attacker to bypass your defenses. \n \n Phishing quote.

We will also discuss threats such as Trojan horses, which combine technical and nontechnical attack techniques. Additionally, we will learn about strategies to help prevent attacks. \n Social Engineering \n \n \n Social engineering is a major security threat. Social engineering refers to the use of a variety of techniques to convince computer users to provide access to their systems. This was popularized by computer and network hacker Kevin Mitnick, who said, “People are prone to taking mental shortcuts. They may know that they shouldn't give out certain information, but the fear of not being nice, the fear of appearing ignorant, the fear of a perceived authority figure — all these are triggers, which can be used by a social engineer to convince a person to override established security procedures.” For example, if a hacker walks up to the secured area of an office building dressed as a package delivery man with his hands full, how many people do you think would open the door to let him in? This type of deception is at the heart of social engineering. \n \n Pretexting\n Pretexting is a form of social engineering. Pretexting occurs when a social engineer presents some limited information to an authorized user to gain access to her computer system or gain access to the business. \n \n EXAMPLE \n \n \n \n A receptionist receives a phone call and the caller says, “Hello, my name is Bob from the IT help desk. We have detected that your computer password has been compromised and needs to be changed. First, can you verify your name and date of birth for me?” At this point, the receptionist provides those details, which can be used to gain access to other accounts. As the call continues, the attacker asks for the receptionist’s username and password, to “verify” that the account has been corrupted. In the end, the receptionist’s account has been compromised by the caller. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Phishing\n Phishing is another form of social engineering. Phishing attacks are an effective and easy way for an attacker to gain access to a system or gain information about a user’s account or financial data. Traditionally, phishing involves the end user receiving an email stating his account has been compromised, or another similar premise. In the email, there is a link to click to reset the password or to log in to his account to verify data. \n When the user clicks the link, he is taken to a website that may look like his bank or other service, but the address may be slightly incorrect. For example, instead of taking the user to Facebook.com, it may be Facebooks.com. When the user enters his username and password, the user is then forwarded to the correct site, but the attackers can now use his compromised credentials in future attacks. In the case of a bank or brokerage account, the attackers can now access that account and transfer the money in the accounts to themselves or collect other details in order to monetize the exploit. \n \n \n \n Baiting\n Baiting occurs when an attacker leaves physical media — such as CDs, DVDs, or USB thumb drives — lying around for a victim to find. Once the victim finds the media, she is curious to find out what is on it (either to learn who the owner is to return it, or to see the confidential data enclosed on the media). Often, these tainted devices could be presented to a victim in a myriad of seemingly legitimate ways, such as a free gift or as a software update. The more enticing the device, such as a smartphone being left around, or the more believable the scenario under which the victim obtains the device (such as a free raffle), the more difficult it is for the victim to recognize the situation as a potential baiting scheme. The best way to prevent a baiting attack is to ensure employees are aware they exist, so they can resist the temptation. \n \n \n \n Shoulder Surfing\n Shoulder surfing occurs when an attacker attempts to gain access to confidential information by looking over a user’s “shoulder” at the user’s screen, keypad, or keyboard. An example is someone looking over your shoulder at the ATM to see your PIN as you type it on the keypad. Another example might be if you are looking at the screen of a billing clerk at a business. The clerk may still have another person’s account (and financial information) up on the screen. Some shoulder surfers act covertly by using mirrors, peeking around corners, or even having hidden video cameras to capture the detailed information they seek. The best defense against this type of attack is to be aware of your surroundings and ensure people remain at a safe visual distance from your terminal. To help prevent shoulder surfing on your laptop and mobile devices, you can also use privacy screen protectors. These special screen protectors prevent screen viewing at an angle, making it difficult for anyone other than the user, who is looking directly at the screen, to see the display. \n \n \n \n Tailgating and Piggybacking\n Tailgating occurs when an attacker attempts to gain access to a secure facility by following closely behind an authorized person without her consent. If this access is gained \xa0 with \xa0 the consent of the authorized person, this is called piggybacking. A great example of this may be when a delivery person, like a pizza delivery or flower delivery person, asks for another employee to hold the door (after the authorized person swiped an ID badge), because the delivery person’s hands are too full of the product being delivered. By doing this, the “delivery person” is able to gain access to the building without authorization. This attack relies on the inherent kindness most people have, and it is hard to teach employees to forgo this common courtesy. \n \n \n \n \n", 'tags': '', 'url': 'p67英.html'}, {'title': 'p68英', 'text': '\n PCS 15 \xa0 / Malware \n Social engineering is a very effective way to gain access to a system without relying exclusively on the technical realm. In addition to social engineering, an attacker may also engineer a technical attack through malware. Notably, an attack combining social engineering with malware can be a significant threat. \n The term malware is a combination of the words malicious and software, and it is used to describe any software used to disrupt or gain unauthorized access to a computer or network. There are numerous types of malware. In this lesson, we will discuss viruses, worms, Trojan horses, rootkits, spyware, remote access, adware, grayware, and spam. \n Viruses \n \n \n Viruses are software programs that infect files in an operating system, wreaking havoc on the system and doing what an attacker wishes. Viruses require replication to spread, and this can only be accomplished when a user executes an infected program containing the virus. Worms are similar to viruses, but they self-replicate across a network. Worms are a very effective type of malware, because they can self-replicate without any user intervention. This also makes worms very dangerous. Trojan horses are programs that claim to be useful utilities but actually install harmful programs on your computer, including spyware, remote access, and rootkits. Trojan horses are usually combined with social engineering, such as phishing, and are used as a delivery mechanism for more serious threats to your computer and network. \n Rootkits \n \n \n \n \n Rootkits are a concealment method used by many types of malware to prevent detection by normal antivirus and antimalware programs. Rootkits tend to overwrite and rename system files, replacing these necessary files with themselves. This embeds the malware into the operating system, making it difficult to detect through standard antivirus software and instead requires advanced detection techniques outside of the normal operating system to detect and remove this variation of malware. Rootkits are activated each time a system boots up. \n \n Rootkit.

A good indication that spyware has infected your computer is if you get multiple pop-up windows when browsing the Internet. Some of these pop-ups may offer you the ability to remove a virus or infection, but you should never use them. These are scams and usually are rogue or fake antivirus/antimalware products that often lead to a deeper infection across your computers and networks. Spyware also can slow down the performance of your computer, wasting valuable computing resources through bloated software code and spying activities. \n Remote Access \n \n \n \n \n Remote access malware programs enable unauthorized control of your system and can be used to set up networks of compromised computers. These malware programs are also known as botnets. Through remote access, attackers can control your computer, capture your keystrokes, turn on your webcam, and copy your files to their own machine, gaining access to your confidential records and accounts. \n Adware, Grayware, and Spam \n \n \n Adware is software that displays pop-up ads and banners related to your web searches and activities. Grayware is a generic term for dialers, joke programs, adware, and spyware programs. Spam is the unwanted receipt of emails from unknown entities, very similar to junk mail received in a physical form at your house. Spam can be malicious (such as trying to send you a virus), a scam (such as trying to get you to send money), or simply ridiculous (such as sending you jokes or other messages you didn’t desire). \n Spam is usually sent by an attacker hijacking a user’s email account by cracking their password, then using that account to send out the mass amounts of spam. For this reason, it is important to frequently change your email account passwords, to prevent a spammer from cracking your password and using your account. \n \n \n \n \n \n P69英 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'p68英.html'}]};
