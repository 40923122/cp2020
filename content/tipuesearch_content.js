When exploring digital security, we will take a deeper dive into user authentication, such as passwords. We will also discuss securing wireless and wired networks. \n Physical Security \n \n \n \n \n While most people think of passwords, encryption, and firewalls as the best methods to protect a computer, they often forget that computer security begins with physical security. While this may sound quaint or silly, it is often the easiest method for an attacker to gain access to a system. After all, what good does a firewall do in protecting your computer from outside attack when the attacker is physically at the computer? \n It is important to ensure that doors are locked so as to ensure the attackers are kept out of the building. Server rooms and communication closets must be kept under lock and key, as these are target-rich environments for attackers. Door locks come in a variety of styles, including the traditional key lock, while some organizations prefer more high-tech physical security devices such as digital numeric keypad locks, radio frequency identification (RFID) card systems, or even biometrics for entry, such as fingerprint readers or retina scanners. \n Not only should the server rooms and communication closets be kept locked, but the main entrance to the facility should be secured, as well. If your organization restricts access to entry points, it is important that you be mindful of tailgating. Tailgating is the practice that occurs when another person tries to enter the facility immediately behind you, effectively using your card swipe or authentication to enter the facility. Many secure facilities use turnstile systems or \xa0 mantraps \xa0 to allow a single employee to enter upon swiping a card key or access badge, or entering a personal identification number. A mantrap is designed to prevent tailgating. \n While physical access can be thwarted by locking doors and preventing tailgating, employees should also be mindful of protecting the physical data that exists in their workplace environment. To prevent work-desk disclosures, you should secure documents in locked file cabinets at the end of the day, shred any sensitive documents at the end of your shift, and refrain from writing down passwords on physical pieces of paper. Another good method to prevent prying eyes from seeing the documents with which you are working on the computer is to utilize a privacy filter over your monitor. \n There are many methods of providing authentication to enter a facility, such as biometrics, key fobs, RFID, and smart cards. Biometric security systems utilize a reader or scanner to analyze the employee’s physical characteristics. For example, if a fingerprint reader is utilized, the reader can find a series of match points from the employee’s fingerprint, then compare them to a database of approved users. For retinal scans, the scanner reads match points in an employee’s retina. Some laptops and mobile devices now incorporate biometric data such as fingerprint readers in place of a username and password. Biometrics are more secure than a traditional username and password, but they are also more intrusive to the employee. Biometrics can also be used to authenticate you by certain unique traits or patterns you have such as comparing baseline models of your signature, voiceprint, heartbeat rhythm, and even keystroke measurements. \n Other security identification methods are key fobs and RFID tags. Key fobs utilize a timing algorithm that is in sync with the global positioning system (GPS) satellites as a time source. The key fob then provides the user with a six-digit code that changes every 15–30 seconds. If the code is not entered within this time period, it becomes invalid and a new code is provided. This code is unique to the user and provides a unique method of authentication. RFID tags can be located in a key fob, access badge, or other device. These devices contain information about the identity of the user, which is passed to a reader using radio frequencies. These RFID tags are often combined with a security badge and a personal identification number (PIN), providing secure, two-factor authentication for the employee at physical access points, such as turnstiles and mantraps. \n \n RFID key fobs by RSA.

The cards act both as identification cards, much like driver’s licenses, and as login credentials for the users’ computers. A smart card contains a small nanoprocessor embedded in the card that contains digital certificates for email signing and encrypting functions. The card is placed into a reader connected to the computer via USB and is unlocked by providing the user’s personal identification number. Use of the smart card provides secure, two-factor authentication by using both the card and the PIN to unlock it. \n \n Sample smart card. Image used under CC-BY-SA license from \xa0 Wikimedia . \n Password Security \n \n \n \n \n \n Security is increasingly a concern in our world, and requires controlling both physical and virtual access. Computer and data protection are vital to businesses large and small, and on a personal level as well. The industry model of authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) has evolved from two-factor authentication to multi-factor authentication. When a user provides simply a username and password, this is considered single-factor authentication. In modern systems, as the need for security increases, so does the need for multiple factors of authentication. \n The authentication measures employers require of employees ensure protections are verified through personal identification. Think of authentication levels as: \n \n Something you know: a username, password, pin, or another type of passcode or phrase. \n Something you have: a Smart Card, RFID tag, or some other token provided by the employer. \n Something you are: Biometric access through voice, fingerprint, or retinal identification. \n Something you do: another form of Biometrics using signature pattern analysis or voiceprint analysis. \n \n “Something the user knows” is the easiest authentication for an attacker to overcome, because the attacker simply needs to guess or collect the user’s knowledge to gain access. “Something the user has” may be more difficult for an attacker to acquire, but not impossible. “Something the user is" should be the most difficult authentication measure to forge, but again, it is not impossible to do so. While movies contain many graphic representations on how to achieve this, there are real technological hacks available that do not require a body part. Biometric sensors can be fooled. “Something the user does” brings biometrics to a new level and is not very common except in the most secure environments. In addition to what somebody is, this authentication creates a baseline for comparative analysis of the person’s known patterns. Signature and voiceprint analysis, keyboards that identify the user by keystroke pressure and typing rate, and even physical measurements of heart rate, body heat, and blood pressure are now being used to complete this fourth type of authentication. \n To ensure a high level of security, many workstations and websites now require a minimum of two-factor authentication. As we previously mentioned, users accessing the Department of Defense computer systems are required to insert their Common Access Card (CAC), which is a Smart Card, and then enter a personal identification number to gain access to the system. This two-factor authentication provides both something the user has (the smart card) and something the user knows (the PIN) to authenticate the user and log the user onto the workstation. \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P62英.html'}, {'title': 'P63英', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'P63英.html'}]};
